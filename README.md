# 🧠 Stress Detection using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on detecting stress levels in individuals using a **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm. It is a Machine Learning-based system that analyzes user input (such as text data, questionnaire results, or physiological signals) to determine stress status.

## 📖 Overview

Stress is a major concern in modern life. This project uses a supervised learning approach to classify whether a person is **stressed** or **not stressed** based on the provided data. The Naive Bayes algorithm is particularly effective for this binary classification task due to its simplicity and performance on text-based data.

## 📊 Dataset

- You can use publicly available datasets such as:
  - **Kaggle**: Stress Detection in Social Media
  - **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Stress questionnaire data
- Or you can create a custom dataset using survey responses or wearable sensor data.

## ✨ Features

- Preprocessing of text/survey data
- Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, tokenization)
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier
- Prediction of stress levels
- Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Collect user data related to stress.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and convert data into numerical format.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Use NLP or statistical methods.
4. **Model Training**: Use Naive Bayes to train on labeled data.
5. **Prediction**: Classify new data as "Stressed" or "Not Stressed".
